# 🧠 AI-Powered Brain Ischemic Stroke Segmentation

## 🚀 Overview

This project is an AI-powered web application for Brain Ischemic Stroke Segmentation using Federated Machine Learning. The frontend is built with Next.js, and the backend is developed using Flask. The system enables secure and decentralized stroke segmentation without sharing sensitive patient data.

## 🛠 Tech Stack

• 🎭 Frontend: Next.js, Tailwind CSS

• 🐍 Backend: Flask, Python

• 🧠 AI Pre-Trained Model: PyTorch/TensorFlow 

## 🏗 Steps

1) Go to backend and run app.py using python "app.py" command on vs code
2) Then Go to frontend and run NEXT JS my-app using "npm run dev"
3) Now upload a 3D-Brain Image on Pre-Trained Model that was built using Federated Machine Learning to identify where Brain Stroke is located.
